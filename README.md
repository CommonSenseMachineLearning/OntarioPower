  ## Initial Questions
  1. What is the forecasts of expected demand and available generation, for years ahead?
  2. What is the forecasts of expected price of consumption power for a year ahead?
  3. How do the consumption of power change in winter and summer?
  4. How do the temperature affect the demand of power? 
  5. What is the forecasts of expected demand and available generation power regarding on regions, for years ahead?
  6. How will the energy resources' proportion change for five years ahead?
